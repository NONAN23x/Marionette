# 🧵 Workshop


# 📖 Description

Workshop is a realistic, story-driven vulnerable Linux machine that simulates common security mistakes found in small development and operational environments.

The lab focuses on:

- Web application vulnerabilities
- Poor credential handling
- Misconfigured automation

- Privilege escalation through unsafe scripting practices

All attack paths are grounded in real-world scenarios rather than artificial CTF tricks.

> ⚠️ This machine is intentionally vulnerable and is meant only for educational use.
